# OBO Tutorial

The [Open Biological and Biomedical Ontologies (OBO)](http://obofoundry.org) provide a suite of high-quality, interoperable, free and open source tools for  sharing scientific knowledge and making new discoveries.

This tutorial reflects the lessons that I've learned using OBO ontologies to work with scientific data. You'll learn how to use OBO ontologies to communicate more clearly, to integrate data, and to improve search and analysis.

We use a single running example to keep things concrete: a spreadsheet of data about histology observations. Starting with this data, we build an application ontology, transform the data into [linked data](http://www.w3.org/standards/semanticweb/data), and then apply an automated reasoner and query over it. All using open source code and tools.

## Requirements

To read through the tutorial and look at most of the files, all you need is a web browser. To view the OWL files you should use the desktop version of [Protégé](http://protege.stanford.edu).

If you want to dig deeper, see [code/README.md](https://github.com/jamesaoverton/obo-tutorial/blob/master/code/README.md).
